# Mock Housing App

# Summary
A mock housing application I created to aid testing of a system I worked on. Also gave me opportunity to play with Spring Boot some more and Angular.

# Mock Housing App
The application I worked on was a CRM application where contacts may or may not be held externally. To aid testing whereby contacts are held externally, I created a stub application which allows me to create tenancies, tennants and addresses.

# Running the application
In order to run the application set the connection details in the application.yml file. The maven package will produce the executeable jar.
